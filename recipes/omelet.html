    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This is the ultimate Western omelet! You can even put red bell 
            peppers and sausage in it, if you like. 
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (Optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 green onions, sliced on the bias</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cooked ham strips</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a small skillet over medium heat. 
                Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and green onions; cook until 
                tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in ham until heated through, 
                about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Set filling 
                mixture aside in a small bowl and keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat eggs together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add remaining 
                1 teaspoon butter; heat until foaming. Pour in eggs and 
                cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that 
                the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes 
                into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the 
                skillet to move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is 
                set but still moist and soft, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the filling over one side of the omelet. 
                Fold the other half over the filling and slide omelet 
                onto a plate.
            </li>
        </ol>
